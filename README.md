# Java II Spring Project ‚Äì REST API + Frontend

This project demonstrates a simple **Spring Boot REST API** with an **H2 in-memory database** and a lightweight **HTML/JavaScript frontend**.  
It was created as part of the Java II course and shows how to build and use a CRUD application with backend‚Äìfrontend interaction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech stack
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.2** (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate)
- **H2 in-memory database** (with H2 console)
- **Maven** ‚Äì build & dependency management
- **Lombok**
- **HTML + JavaScript** ‚Äì simple frontend consuming the API

## üìë Example requests (Postman / curl)

### üü¢ Create a team
```http
POST http://localhost:8081/addTeam
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "nazovTimu": "Spartans",
  "skratkaTimu": "SPR",
  "krajinaPovodu": "SK"
}
```

### Create a player (with team id 1)
```http
POST http://localhost:8081/addPlayer
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "meno": "Jozef",
  "priezvisko": "Mrkva",
  "pozicia": "Forward",
  "datumNarodenia": "2000-05-01",
  "tim": { "id": 1 }
}
```

### GetAllTeams 
```http
GET http://localhost:8081/getAllTeams
```


## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (NovyProjektJava.html)

The project also includes a simple **HTML/JavaScript frontend** that consumes the REST API.

### How to use
1. Start the backend (**ProjektRestApp**) on [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).  
2. Open `NovyProjektJava.html` in your browser.  
3. The page allows you to:
   - view teams, players, and coaches,
   - add new records,
   - update existing ones,
   - delete records.

This way, you can interact with the application through a **web interface** without needing Postman.
